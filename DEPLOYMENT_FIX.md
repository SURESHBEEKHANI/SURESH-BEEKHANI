# Deployment Fix

## Issue
The Netlify build is failing due to `netlify-plugin-image-optim` plugin error.

## Solution

Go to your Netlify Dashboard and disable the problematic plugin:

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site
3. Go to **Site Settings** → **Build & Deploy** → **Build Plugins**
4. Find **netlify-plugin-image-optim**
5. Click **Remove** or **Disable**

## Alternative: Keep the plugin but fix the error

The plugin is trying to optimize images but encountering an error. You can either:
- Remove it (recommended for now)
- Update it to the latest version in the Netlify UI

## After Fixing

Once you remove the plugin, redeploy:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove API keys from docs"
git push
```

Or trigger a manual deploy from Netlify dashboard.

## Good News

Your build actually succeeded! The error is only in the post-build image optimization step. Your functions are deployed and working:
- ✅ chat.js
- ✅ config.js
- ✅ embeddings.js
- ✅ llm-service.js
- ✅ retry-handler.js
- ✅ service-health.js
- ✅ vector-store.js

The chatbot should be working on your live site despite this error!
