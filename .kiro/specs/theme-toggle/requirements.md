# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable users to switch between light and dark modes across the entire website. The theme toggle will provide a seamless user experience by persisting the user's preference across sessions and applying the selected theme consistently throughout all pages and components. The implementation will leverage the existing Tailwind CSS dark mode configuration and provide an intuitive UI control for theme switching.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Theme Toggle UI Component

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a theme toggle button in the navigation area, so that I can easily switch between light and dark modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a theme toggle button/icon in a prominent location (header/navigation area)
2. WHEN the user hovers over the theme toggle button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (e.g., tooltip, color change)
3. WHEN the user clicks the theme toggle button THEN the system SHALL switch between light and dark themes instantly
4. IF the current theme is light THEN the toggle button SHALL display a moon icon or dark mode indicator
5. IF the current theme is dark THEN the toggle button SHALL display a sun icon or light mode indicator
6. WHEN the theme changes THEN the toggle button icon SHALL update to reflect the new state

### Requirement 2: Theme Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my theme preference to be remembered, so that I don't have to reselect it every time I visit the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a theme THEN the system SHALL store the preference in localStorage
2. WHEN the user returns to the website THEN the system SHALL load and apply the saved theme preference
3. IF no theme preference exists in localStorage THEN the system SHALL use the user's system preference (prefers-color-scheme)
4. WHEN the theme preference is stored THEN the system SHALL use a consistent key name (e.g., "theme" or "color-mode")

### Requirement 3: Global Theme Application

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme to apply consistently across all pages and components, so that I have a cohesive visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme is changed THEN the system SHALL apply the theme to all visible components immediately
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the selected theme without flickering
3. WHEN the dark theme is active THEN the system SHALL add the "dark" class to the root HTML element
4. WHEN the light theme is active THEN the system SHALL remove the "dark" class from the root HTML element
5. WHEN lazy-loaded components render THEN the system SHALL apply the current theme to those components

### Requirement 4: Smooth Theme Transitions

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth visual transitions when switching themes, so that the change feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme switches THEN the system SHALL apply CSS transitions to color changes
2. WHEN the theme switches THEN the transition duration SHALL be between 200-300ms for optimal user experience
3. WHEN the theme switches THEN the system SHALL prevent layout shift or content jumping

### Requirement 5: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the theme toggle to be keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly, so that I can use it regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the theme toggle SHALL be focusable via Tab key
2. WHEN the theme toggle is focused THEN the system SHALL display a visible focus indicator
3. WHEN the user presses Enter or Space on the focused toggle THEN the system SHALL switch the theme
4. WHEN using a screen reader THEN the toggle SHALL announce its current state (e.g., "Switch to dark mode" or "Switch to light mode")
5. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL update the aria-label or aria-pressed attribute accordingly

### Requirement 6: Initial Load Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the correct theme to load immediately without flashing the wrong theme, so that I have a seamless experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL apply the saved theme before the first paint
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL NOT show a flash of the wrong theme (FOUC - Flash of Unstyled Content)
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL use an inline script or early initialization to set the theme class
4. IF the user has no saved preference THEN the system SHALL respect the system's prefers-color-scheme media query
