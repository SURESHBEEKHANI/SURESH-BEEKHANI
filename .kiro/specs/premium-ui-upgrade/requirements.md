# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to upgrade the existing React website's UI/UX to achieve a premium, clean, and professional aesthetic comparable to modern SaaS platforms like Linear, Notion, and Vercel. The upgrade will focus on visual enhancements while preserving all existing functionality, text content, and the Lenis smooth scrolling integration. The implementation will leverage Framer Motion for sophisticated animations, maintain Tailwind CSS for styling consistency, and apply modern design principles including glassmorphism, smooth transitions, depth shadows, and soft gradients.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Preserve Existing Functionality

3. WHEN users navigate between sections THEN all anchor links and routing SHALL function identically to the current implementation
4. WHEN the website loads THEN all existing integrations (Google Analytics, Chatbot, etc.) SHALL remain operational
5. IF any component has state management THEN the state logic SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 2: Maintain Content Integrity

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want all text content to remain exactly as it is, so that messaging and information stay consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are redesigned THEN all text content SHALL remain identical to the original
2. WHEN typography is updated THEN only font families, sizes, weights, and spacing SHALL be modified

### Requirement 6: Optimize Layout and Spacing

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent spacing and layout throughout the site, so that the design feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any section THEN padding and margins SHALL follow a consistent spacing system (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
