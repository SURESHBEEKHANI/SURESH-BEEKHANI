# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chatbot service currently displays a generic error message when the AI service fails to connect or respond. The full RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline needs comprehensive improvements including better connection handling, error recovery, and service integration between the vector store (Pinecone), embedding service (HuggingFace), and LLM service (Groq). This feature will enhance the entire RAG pipeline to provide robust error handling, graceful degradation, better diagnostics, and seamless service connectivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Improved Error Detection and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error logging and detection, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues with the AI service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Groq API key is missing THEN the system SHALL log a clear error message indicating the missing configuration
2. WHEN the Groq API connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error type (network, authentication, rate limit, etc.)
3. WHEN the vector store search fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue with empty context
4. IF an error occurs THEN the system SHALL include error codes and timestamps in logs for debugging

### Requirement 2: User-Friendly Error Messages

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want clear and helpful error messages, so that I understand what's happening and what I can do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API key is not configured THEN the system SHALL return a message directing users to contact Suresh directly
2. WHEN the service experiences a temporary failure THEN the system SHALL return a message indicating the issue is temporary and to try again
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a message explaining the situation and suggesting to try again in a few moments
4. IF the service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative contact methods (email, contact form link)

### Requirement 3: Graceful Degradation

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the chatbot to remain functional even when some services fail, so that I can still get basic information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the vector store fails THEN the system SHALL continue with LLM service using empty context
2. WHEN the LLM service fails THEN the system SHALL return a fallback message with contact information
3. IF both services fail THEN the system SHALL return a helpful message with alternative ways to reach Suresh
4. WHEN partial context is available THEN the system SHALL use whatever context is available rather than failing completely

### Requirement 4: Service Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor the health of AI services, so that I can proactively address issues before users encounter them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat function initializes THEN the system SHALL verify API key presence
2. WHEN a request is made THEN the system SHALL track response times and success rates
3. IF multiple consecutive failures occur THEN the system SHALL log a critical alert
4. WHEN services recover THEN the system SHALL log the recovery event

### Requirement 5: Retry Logic and Resilience

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the system to automatically retry failed requests, so that temporary glitches don't prevent me from getting answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL retry the request up to 2 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN a rate limit error occurs THEN the system SHALL wait and retry after the specified time
3. IF all retries fail THEN the system SHALL return a user-friendly error message
4. WHEN a timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL cancel the request and return a timeout message after 30 seconds

### Requirement 6: Vector Store Connection Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable Pinecone vector store connections, so that context retrieval works consistently for the RAG pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Pinecone API key is missing THEN the system SHALL log a configuration error and continue without vector search
2. WHEN Pinecone connection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 2 times
3. IF Pinecone is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue with LLM-only mode without context
4. WHEN vector search succeeds THEN the system SHALL validate the returned embeddings before use
5. IF embedding dimension mismatch occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error and skip that result

### Requirement 7: Embedding Service Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable HuggingFace embedding generation, so that user queries can be properly vectorized for semantic search.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HuggingFace API key is missing THEN the system SHALL log a warning and attempt to use alternative embedding methods
2. WHEN embedding generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 2 times before falling back
3. IF HuggingFace is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use a fallback embedding strategy or keyword search
4. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL validate the dimension matches the expected size (384)

### Requirement 8: End-to-End RAG Pipeline Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate the entire RAG pipeline on startup, so that I can detect configuration issues before users encounter errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service initializes THEN the system SHALL check all required API keys (Groq, Pinecone, HuggingFace)
2. WHEN API keys are present THEN the system SHALL attempt test connections to each service
3. IF any service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log warnings with specific service names
4. WHEN all services are healthy THEN the system SHALL log a success message with service status
5. IF critical services fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for configuration

### Requirement 9: Context Quality and Relevance

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want relevant and accurate responses, so that I get useful information about Suresh's work and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN context is retrieved THEN the system SHALL filter results below the similarity threshold (0.5)
2. WHEN multiple contexts are found THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance score
3. IF no relevant context is found THEN the system SHALL inform the LLM to provide general AI/ML insights
4. WHEN context is used THEN the system SHALL include metadata about context quality in the response
